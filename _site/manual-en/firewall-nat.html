>4.1. Overview</H1
><P
>With the new 2.4.x Kernel and iptables, NAT and Masquerade are handled by
the Netfilter module in the kernel.
With these rules we can change source and destination item of the connection,
and this is useful when we want to redirect all the traffic destinated to
host 'X' to another host 'Y'.</P
><P
>If, for example, our provider assigned us some public addresses but our web
server is situated in a dmz with a private address, to make this server accessible
from outside we need to set a NAT rule which redirects all the connections
destinated to the public address we chose for our web server towards its
private address (real). The client which establishes the connection won't
notice anything and will believe really to communicate with a web server
whose IP address is public.</P
><P
>Masquerading is a particular case of NATting and it is applied when we want
that connections between 2 zones seem, to the destination zone, as if they
came from our firewall. Masquerading is commonly used for connections towards
Internet: we don't want that our internal hosts are identified by Internet
hosts so we tell our firewall to masquerade all communications toward outside.
The connection will appear, to Internet hosts, to come from our firewall.</P
